# Python Challenge

UCB Bootcamp - Challenge 3 - Python

## Objective

To analyse the budget data and election data provided to us in csv format.

## Summary

This exercise was divided in two parts:
1. In the first part, we analyzed the given budget data. Here, we tried to understand how the budget changed over the given amount of time and what was the greatest increase and greatest decrease.
2. In the second part, we analyzed election data provided to us. The csv provided us the Ballot ID, County and Candidate Voted For. We mostly focused on the candidate column to see how many people voted and who got the majority share of the vote and won the elections.
